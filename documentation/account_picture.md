# Using AccountsService

There is a file for every user in `/var/lib/accountsservice/users/` which specifies the following:
```
[User]
XSession=i3
Icon=/var/lib/accountsservice/icons/thomas.png
SystemAccount=false
```

In order to change the account picture, either copy it to the specified path or adapt the path.
