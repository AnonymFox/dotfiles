# dotfiles
This is a project for my personally used dotfiles.
Use at own risk.

## VIM
For the given vim configuration to work, the YouCompleteMe autocomplete plugin has to be built and properly installed. See the [documentation]{https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/} for further reference.
Note that submodules have to be pulled with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
