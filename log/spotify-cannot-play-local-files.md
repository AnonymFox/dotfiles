# Spotify can't play local files
Error: "This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer, you can import it."

Solution: install `ffmpeg-compat-54` from the AUR

If pgp error appears, import the keyserver
```
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys FCF986EA15E6E293A5644F10B4322F04D67658D8
```
