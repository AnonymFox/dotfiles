# Fix dark in put fields in firefox

1. Start firefox with a light theme, e.g. `GTK_THEME=Arc firefox`
2. Install a dark theme, e.g. Arc dark theme, to enable dark theme only for browser window, not websites.
3. Copy the desktop file from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications and edit the `Exec` line accordingly
